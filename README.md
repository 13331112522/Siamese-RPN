# Siamese-RPN

pytorch version of the SiameseRPN tracker descirbed in the paper "High Performance Visual Tracking with Siamese Region Proposal Network".

This repository includes training and tracking codes. 

python version == 3.6.5

pytorch version == 0.4.0

Without using imagenet pretrain or youtube-bb dataset, this code can get 0.545 auc on OTB50, and 0.2 EAO on VOT2015. The paper's model can get 0.33 EAO on VOT2017 without these.

We are still trying to reimplement the results in paper.

If you found any bug or have any suggestion about this code, hope you can tell us.
